## How to install

On this directory, run:

    python -m pip install .

## How to use:

### Proposed Method 1: <u>**DTW-AROW**</u> (DTW with Additional Restrictions on Warping)

A *local* method that only uses the two time series that are compared with each other.

It requires just the two time series (possibly with missing values) to compute the DTW distance between them.

The two time series that are compared can have different lengths and can be multivariate (with the same number of dimensions).

Example (see `notebooks/example_dtw_arow.ipynb`):

    import numpy as np
    import dtw_missing.dtw_missing as dtw_m
    import dtw_missing.dtw_missing_visualisation as dtw_m_vis

    x = np.array([0, 0, np.nan, np.nan, 1.7, 0.8, 0.4, 0.4, 1.1, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.3, 0, 0]) + 0.15
    y = np.array([0, 1, 1.5, 1.5, 1.3, 0, 0, np.nan, 1.1, 1.1, 0])

    # Calculate only the distance:
    d = dtw_m.warping_paths(y, x)[0]
    print(f'distance = {d}')

    # Calculate the distance and plot the warping:
    d, paths, best_path = dtw_m.warping_paths(y, x, return_optimal_warping_path=True)
    dtw_m_vis.plot_warpingpaths(y, x, paths, best_path, showlegend=True)
    dtw_m_vis.plot_warping(y, x, best_path, figsize=(4,3))


### Proposed Method 2: <u>**DTW-CAI**</u> (DTW with Clustering, Averaging, and Imputation)

A *global* method that uses not only the time series that are compared with each other, but also other time series in the dataset to leverage contextual information.

It requires a time series dataset to estimate the pairwise DTW distances between the instances.

The implementation requires a dataset that contains only univariate time series of the same length; however, it is straightforward to update it to handle multivariate time series of different lengths.

Example (see `notebooks/example_dtw_cai.ipynb`):

    import numpy as np
    import dtw_missing.experiments as exp

    # Create a simple dataset with missing values:
    dataset = np.array([[1, 1, np.nan, 5, 5, 2, 2], 
                        [1, 5, np.nan, np.nan, 5, 5, 2], 
                        [1.5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, np.nan], 
                        [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, 10, 10, 10]
                      ])
    
    # Both DTW-AROW and DTW-CAI parameters can be specified (because DTW-CAI uses DTW-AROW):
    dtw_params = {}
    dtw_cai_params = dict(no_clusters='elbow', no_clusters_range_for_elbow=(2,4)) 
        # â†‘ limit the range because of the small dataset
    
    # Execute the DTW-CAI algorithm and get the pairwise distances:
    e_dtw_cai = exp.Experiment()
    e_dtw_cai.dataset = dataset
    e_dtw_cai.compute_pairwise_distances('dtw_cai', 
                                     missing_method_params=[dtw_params, dtw_cai_params],
                                     progress_bar=True, n_jobs=1)


### How to choose between DTW-AROW and DTW-CAI:

- DTW-AROW is much faster and does not require the full dataset.

- DTW-CAI performs more accurately in estimating DTW distances on the average for multiple datasets.
